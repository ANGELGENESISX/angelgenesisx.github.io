TIME spotlights Colossal\u2019s work decoding ancient DNA and applying genome engineering to reintroduce this extinct predator. Unlike wolves we know today, the dire wolf was a distinct species that once roamed North America, and its revival is a landmark moment in the de-extinction movement. The article explores the challenges of building viable genomes, the broader ethical debates surrounding species restoration, and Colossal\u2019s ambitions to use this work for ecological good. With a blend of scientific rigor and bold vision, the company is turning sci-fi into real-world innovation \u2014 and sparking a global conversation along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Read the full feature in <em><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/7274542\/colossal-dire-wolf\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Colossal Biosciences has brought the legendary dire wolf back to life \u2014 not as a museum piece, but as a [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[12,5],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2183","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-home-page","category-news"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2183","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2183"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2183\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2183"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2183"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/colossal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2183"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
