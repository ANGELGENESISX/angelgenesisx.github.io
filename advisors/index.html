						<p>Dr. Austin Gallagher is a globally-activated marine biologist and social entrepreneur, best known for his research on megafauna, particularly sharks. He is the founder of The Beneath the Waves Group, which controls six companies engaged in cutting-edge marine research and exploration, technology, climate solutions, and carbon finance. He serves as CEO to core asset Beneath the Waves Inc., a next-generation NGO research institute engaged in marine projects worldwide, with a focus on North America and The Caribbean. Gallagher’s approach combines research, private sector collaboration, local engagement, and media – to create effective partnerships.Dr. Gallagher has worked diligently studying and advocating for highly migratory species and their habitats around the world, directly supporting the protection of species and hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of ocean. He has served as the lead scientist on 50+ global scientific expeditions across six continents, and is broadly trained with expertise spanning large animal tracking, behavioral ecology, physiology, genetics, plant biology, and socioeconomics.</p>
					</div> <!--col-->
					<div class="col-md-6 right">
						<p>He has published over 100 scientific papers, spanning research on the migrations of ocean giants, blue carbon, deep-sea exploration, and marine policy, and sits on the Editorial Board of Endangered Species Research. He has forged dozens of firsts in the marine industry, ranging from the identification of new species and geographic records, to implementing new technologies to accelerate conservation solutions. In 2020, he partnered with wild tiger sharks to discover the world’s largest seagrass meadow, an area over 93,000 sq. km representing the ocean’s largest carbon sink, a discovery valued at over $400 billion. This discovery paved the way for his founding of Blueprint, a company focused on providing governments and corporations an end-to-end solution for blue carbon project management – from science to credits. Dr. Gallagher is regularly consulted by US Congress, international governments, and he has briefed and collaborated with over 10 Heads of State to prompt and develop legislation and policies to protect threatened ocean habitat, species, and the communities that depend on them. He is a National Geographic Explorer, Fellow of the Explorers Club, Fulbright Scholar, former Forbes 30 Under 30 winner, and is an Adjunct Professor at both The University of Exeter and Northeastern University.</p>

						<p>Dr. Taylor is a dynamic innovator, scientist and entrepreneur and a global thought leader and speaker in regenerative medicine. She is recognized as a thought leader in biomanufacturing as evidenced by her recent service on a White House panel, has published over 180 papers, holds over 30 patents, and is the founder of multiple companies, one of which went public last year (MIRO;NASDAQ). She has trained hundreds of undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate fellows worldwide in her laboratories in the U.S. and Europe. Although she held academic positions for over 20 years, she recently founded RegenMedix Consulting LLC to enable academic and commercial enterprises in the regenerative medicine space. In 2021, she founded a new biotech Organamet Bio Inc. to bioengineer personalized replacement hearts on demand. The latest breakthrough in that technology was featured on CNN in September 2022 (https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2022/09/15/cfc-gupta-taylor.cnn). Taylor is credited with the first functional scientific repair of an injured heart with stem cells in 1998. Her group further transformed the field of organ transplantation science in 2008 by developing a unique cell removal (decellularization) method that makes un-transplantable organs into usable scaffold frameworks for building new organs with stem cells. This was so revolutionary it was recognized as one of the “Top 10 Research Advances” by the American Heart Association and Taylor was nominated as one of “100 Most Influential People in the World” by Time Magazine. Next, she turned to disease prevention and has begun to develop “cellular signatures” of heart disease and aging that appear to differ by sex, race and ethnicity.</p>
					</div> <!--col-->
					<div class="col-md-6 right">
						<p>Dr. Taylor frequently appears as an expert on molecular biology, biobanking, cell therapy, women’s health, cardiac repair and organ transplantation in the public media. Her work has been recognized and featured by 60 Minutes, CNN, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, National Geographic, BBC Horizon, BBC News Health, ABC, NBC and CBS News, Associated Press, Good Morning America, the Oprah Winfrey Show, NOVA Science Now, PBS NOVA's Transplanting Hope, Discovery Channel’s Through the Worm Hole with Morgan Freeman, Science Channel’s Stem Cell Universe with Stephen Hawking, NPR’s On Being with Krista Tippet and most other worldwide media outlets. Taylor sits on numerous think tanks and international scientific committees including for the NIH, the FDA, the American Association of Blood Banks, and the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. She serves as a member of the Leadership Advisory Committee for the Alliance for Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) and sat on the international jury for the Institut de France LeFoulon-Delalande Foundation Grand Prix which is awarded annually to individuals making worldwide contributions to cardiovascular medicine. Dr. Taylor earned a B.S. from Mississippi University for Women (MUW) and a Ph.D. from UT Southwestern Medical Center. She is appointed as a Fellow of the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society for Cardiology. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by MUW and the national Distinguished Alumnus Award by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. In 2019 she was elected as a Senior member of the National Academy of Inventors and in 2020, was elected as a fellow to the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Her motto is “Build the Future of Medicine Today.”</p>

						<p>Galante is wildlife biologist and owner of Phantasticus Pictures (a wildlife media company) and host of several successful wildlife tv shows. His focus is on animals facing extinction, whether it be mislabeling or because of human wildlife conflicts. After growing up in the bush of Zimbabwe as the son of a safari business owner, Galante and his family fled to the United States where he finished his formal education. As a young and hungry biologist with a degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Galante pursued a career in high-risk wildlife biology fieldwork. Galante’s hands-on approach to wildlife, passion for nature and extraordinary background in tracking animals eventually led to the development of his own television show, Extinct or Alive, on Animal Planet. The show followed Galante as he traveled the globe searching for animals he believed have wrongfully been deemed extinct.</p>
					</div> <!--col-->
					<div class="col-md-6 right">
						<p>Since 2018, Galante has captured evidence of the existence of eight animals once believed to be extinct. Galante continues to conduct field expeditions and surveys, working not just with believed-extinct animals but also with a wide range of other wildlife. His mission is to inspire and educate people about animals and adventure through the media, including hosting a wide range of programs on Discovery, on-camera expert interviews, and production of his own wildlife and natural history shows via his production company. He also communicates his mission through his public speaking at Congress, the United Nations and via his active social media presence. Galante is the most notable name on the topic of animals wrongfully being labeled extinct and brings a unique and experienced field perspective to the topic of de-extinction.</p>

						<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, D.Phil., CBE, is an authority on elephant behaviour and conservation. He attended Gordonstoun School, and later Oxford University where he earned a degree in Zoology and a D.Phil studying the Ecology and Behaviour of the African Elephant. His work in the 1960s paved the way for much of today’s understanding of elephants and current conservation practices. During the 1970s, he investigated the status of elephants throughout Africa and was the first to alert the world to the ivory poaching crisis. He chronicled the diminution of Africa’s elephant population by half between 1979 and 1989 and was instrumental in bringing about the world ivory trade ban. In 1993, Douglas-Hamilton founded Save the Elephants (STE) a charity dedicated specifically to elephants. Since that time Save the Elephants has conducted research on elephants across Africa and has increased public awareness of the many dangers that threaten elephants and the habitats in which they live. Fundamental to his work at STE, Douglas-Hamilton pioneered GPS tracking of elephants in Africa, which has become a standard and widely emulated survey technique; it also guides the deployment of rangers to protect vulnerable and key elephant populations.</p>
					</div> <!--col-->
					<div class="col-md-6 right">
						<p>Douglas-Hamilton and his wife, Oria, have co-authored two award-winning books, Among the Elephants (1975) and Battle for the Elephants (1992), and have made several television films. Dr. Iain Douglas-Hamilton was awarded the 2010 Indianapolis Prize, one of the world’s leading awards for animal conservation. In 2013, The Elephant Crisis Fund (a joint initiative between Save the Elephants and San Francisco based NGO Wildlife Conservation Network) was established to confront the threat to elephants by supporting the most urgent, important and catalytic projects across the crisis to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and end the demand for ivory. In October 2014, he was presented with the George B. Rabb Conservation Medal by the Chicago Zoological Society (CZS) for his authoritative work to benefit African elephants. In 2015, he was awarded the Commander of the British Empire and was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award by San Diego Zoological Society with most recently being awarded the Tanzanian Wildlife Research Institute’s (TAWIRI) Tanzania Wildlife Research Award for his lifelong devotion to elephants. Currently, he is focused on winning hearts and minds to help reduce the demand for ivory and focus on understanding elephants' reasons for movements and their deep history in time.</p>

										<p>Dr. Leopold Eckhart is Associate Professor in the Department of Dermatology at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. His research is focused on the molecular architecture and evolution of the skin and its appendages in vertebrates. Dr. Eckhart’s studies have revealed mechanisms by which the skin of reptiles, birds and mammals forms a barrier against a dry environment to facilitate life on land. His team has defined and characterized catalogs of skin barrier genes in all major phylogenetic<br />
groups of terrestrial vertebrates. The identification and comparative analysis of protein components of hair, feathers, claws, and scales has led to a comprehensive model for the evolutionary diversification of the skin in vertebrates. Dr. Eckhart’s research group has found a genetic program that controls skin appendages in a wide range of species ranging from clawed frogs to humans. The results of these studies have implications for basic skin biology and dermatology. Dr. Eckhart’s research has been funded through competitive grants from the Austrian Science Fund.</p>

										<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Karl Koehler is an Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital. He also serves as a Principal Investigator in the FM Kirby Center for Neurobiology. After earning his PhD in Medical Neuroscience from Indiana University School of Medicine in 2014, he quickly established his laboratory there, before transitioning to Boston Children’s Hospital in 2019. Dr. Koehler&#8217;s research is dedicated to understanding how embryonic cells coalesce to shape the organs responsible for our auditory, vestibular, visual, tactile, and nociceptive senses. A cornerstone of his work is the development of organoid models, which are cell culture representations of the human embryo formed using stem cells. Dr. Koehler&#8217;s team pioneered the creation of the inner ear organoid; a significant advancement now being leveraged to progress gene therapies for disorders affecting hearing and balance. Another noteworthy achievement of his team came in 2020 when they produced human skin organoids capable of growing hair and sensory nerves. This innovation holds promise in fields ranging from skin disease research and advanced wound treatment to investigations into the evolutionary trajectory of skin and hair attributes across different species. His work has been funded through numerous grants from the Department of Defense, National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, and philanthropic gifts.</p>

										<p data-start="180" data-end="526">Peter Nichols leads groundbreaking initiatives in lipid technology and marine oils, with a particular focus on health-benefitting omega-3 oils. His research spans the detailed characterization of fish-derived and novel microbial oils, as well as process development for their utilization in both human health and environmental applications.</p>
<p data-start="528" data-end="979">As part of a CSIRO team, Peter played a pivotal role in developing novel land-plant sources of long-chain omega-3 oils. Over more than two decades, this project culminated in the commercialization of a new Australian canola variety, engineered using GM technology to produce long-chain omega-3 oils. The resulting products, Aquaterra and Nutriterra—licensed to Australian company Nufarm/Nuseed—are now used globally in aquafeeds and human nutrition.</p>
<p data-start="981" data-end="1476">Throughout his career, Peter’s work has driven innovation in the Australian marine oils industry, resulting in novel products such as wax ester, omega-3, and shark liver oils. His contributions have improved the utilization of national fisheries resources and wastes, while also supporting the development of new oilseed crops. His pioneering use of chemical (lipid) signatures has advanced studies in microbial ecology, environmental monitoring, food-chain analysis, and marine biotechnology.</p>

										<p><strong>Florian Hollfelder</strong> was educated at the Technical University of Berlin (Diplom-Chemiker) and Cambridge University (MPhil). After a formative stay at Stanford (with <a href="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biochem/herschlag/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dan Herschlag</a>) on free-energy relationships in enzymes) he joined <a href="http://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/staff/ajk.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tony Kirby’s</a> group at the Chemistry Department of Cambridge University working on enzyme models and physical-organic chemistry. During his PhD he also collaborated with <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biological_Chemistry/scientist/Tawfik/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dan Tawfik</a> (on the mechanism and evaluation of model enzymes such as catalytic antibodies). His postdoctoral work at Harvard Medical School (with <a href="http://walsh.med.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chris T. Walsh</a>) was concerned with the biosynthesis and action of the natural antibiotic microcin B17.</p>
<p>In 2001 he returned to Cambridge to start his own research group in the Biochemistry Department, where he is Professor in Chemical and Synthetic Biology. The group’s research centres around quantitative and mechanistic questions at the chemistry/biology interface, involving low- and high-throughput approaches. Mechanistic work focuses on enzymatic bioreactions and their organic chemical counterparts, on strategies for finding and creating enzymes with novel reactions and on the pathways by which these can be enhanced by directed evolution. Most recently this approach has been extended to mechanisms of cellular development and embryology. A key technology under development in the group are ultrahigh throughput approaches for directed evolution, cell development in 3D and single cell transcriptomics.</p>
<p>Florian has held ERC Advanced and Starting Grants and coordinated several EU-funded trans-national collaborative initiatives, e.g. the H2020 research training networks <a href="https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/node/161" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MMBio</a> (&#8216;<em>Molecular Tools for Nucleic Acid Manipulation for Biological Intervention</em>&#8216;) and <a href="https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/node/137" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ES-Cat</a> (&#8216;<em>Directed Protein Evolution for Synthetic Biology and Biocatalysis</em>’), ENDIRPRO &amp; ENEFP on directed evolution of functional proteins, ProSA on protein-protein interactions and PhosChemRec on the chemical biology of phosphates. He is coordinator of the BBSRC sLOLA grant “Novel Plastizymes”, member of the EU Horizon Europe projects “BlueTools “and “BlueRemediomics” (on metagenomic exploration of marine biospheres) and co-founder of the companies DropTech and Evoralis. Florian is a Staff Fellow at Trinity Hall, where he acted as Tutor, Director of Studies and Graduate Mentor.</p>

										<p>Dr. Jun Wu is an associate professor in the department of molecular biology at UT southwestern medical center. Dr. Wu’s work has contributed to the development of novel culture systems and methods that enable the generation of new stem cells for basic and translational studies. Dr. Wu has expanded the spectrum of pluripotent states by capturing mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) with distinct molecular and phenotypic features from different developmental stages. And some of these culture conditions developed in mice enabled the generation of PSCs from many other mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, and ungulates. In addition, Dr. Wu has developed efficient and versatile blastocyst complementation methods for <em>in vivo</em> generation of functional tissues and organs from cultured PSCs, and several stem cell derived embryo models. Dr. Wu has received several awards including UT southwestern endowed scholar (2017), CPRIT scholar (2017), NYSCF-Robertson Stem Cell Investigator award (2022), and the ISSCR Outstanding Young Investigator Award (2024).</p>

										<p>Dr. Joanna Lambert is a scientist and tenured professor of evolutionary ecology and conservation biology at the University of Colorado – Boulder, where she also serves as Director of the American Canid Project.  Born and raised in industrial England and an immigrant to the Rust Belt of the United States, Joanna Lambert spent her formative years observing wildlife in heavily urbanized landscapes. She has spent her adult life making up for this by traveling to some of the planet&#8217;s most remote regions to study wild animals in wild places. Her research has now taken her to all seven continents, but a major focus has been on equatorial Africa, where she studies primates such as chimpanzees, and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where she studies carnivores such as grey wolves.</p>
<p>Lambert has published several books and hundreds of peer-reviewed articles on her research on the behavioral ecology, physiology, and evolution of wild mammals. For her efforts, she has been elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the Linnaean Society of London – the institution where Charles Darwin first presented his theory of evolution.  Previous to her position at the University of Colorado &#8211; Boulder, Lambert was a Professor at the University of Texas, a Visiting Scientist at Duke University, an Associate Professor at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, an Assistant Professor at the University of Oregon, and Program Director at the National Science Foundation.  She is also a Master Instructor at the Yellowstone Institute and teaches intensive field seminars in Yellowstone National Park.  She has held numerous Editorial positions for peer-reviewed science journals such as <em>Frontiers in Mammal Science, Oecologia, PLoS ONE, Diversity, Integrative Zoology, Tropical Conservation Science, American Journal of Biological Anthropology, American Journal of Primatology</em>, and African Primates.</p>
<p>Throughout almost 40 years of field research worldwide, she has witnessed extraordinary challenges to biodiversity and human quality of life – realities that have fundamentally impacted her approach to science.  She has no patience for scientists who remain cloistered in the Ivory Tower.  Now, in addition to being a field scientist and educator, she is also a conservation practitioner and activist.  In this capacity, she serves as a member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission, as a science advisor to the United Nations Environmental Programme, as Chief Science Officer of Conservation Nation, and as Senior Science Advisor and Board Member of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project.  One of Joanna’s proudest rewilding accomplishments has been playing a central role in reintroducing endangered gray wolves into Colorado.  In her spare time, Joanna spends as much time as she can off-grid in wild and rugged places, preferably on a horse and with her dogs, striving for optimism and solutions in a challenging world.</p>

										<div class="spacer-sm"></div>

										<p>Galante is wildlife biologist and owner of Phantasticus Pictures (a wildlife media company) and host of several successful wildlife tv shows. His focus is on animals facing extinction, whether it be mislabeling or because of human wildlife conflicts. After growing up in the bush of Zimbabwe as the son of a safari business owner, Galante and family fled to the United States where he finished his formal education. As a young and hungry biologist with a degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Galante pursued a career in high-risk wildlife biology fieldwork. Galante’s hands-on approach to wildlife, passion for nature and extraordinary background in tracking animals eventually led to the development of his own television show, Extinct or Alive, on Animal Planet. The show followed Galante as he traveled the globe searching for animals he believed have wrongfully been deemed extinct. Since 2018, Galante has captured evidence of the existence of eight animals once believed to be extinct. Galante continues to conduct field expeditions and surveys, working not just with believed-extinct animals but also with a wide range of other wildlife. His mission is to inspire and educate people about animals and adventure through the media, including hosting a wide range of programs on Discovery, on-camera expert interviews, and production of his own wildlife and natural history shows via his production company. He also communicates his mission through his public speaking, at congress, at the United Nations and via his active social media presence. Galante is the most notable name on the topic of animals wrongfully being labeled extinct and brings a unique and experienced field perspective to the topic of de-extinction.</p>

										<p>A native Swede, born to an Indian mother and a Canadian father, Ben grew up in Toronto, New York and Stockholm. He graduated from the Stockholm art school with a degree in fine arts, but a chance meeting with perfumer Pierre Wulff convinced him that he&#8217;d rather create fragrances than paintings. With no formal training in the field, Gorham, 31 years old , sought out the services of world renowned perfumers Olivia Giacobetti and Jerome Epinette, explaining his olfactory desires and letting them create the compositions. As an outsider in the beauty industry, Ben is somewhat of an anomaly and has been recognized for his personal style and connection to fashion and art in several international magazines such as French Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle, V Magazine and Fantastic Man to name a few.</p>

										<p>Mead Treadwell, Fellow National &#8217;02, is former Lt. Governor of Alaska, 2010-2014, and has been involved in Arctic exploration and political/economic/environmental cooperation in the region since the late 1970&#8217;s when he focused his undergraduate work in history and policy at Yale on Law of the Sea and developing better methods to manage fisheries in the North Pacific and Bering Seas. In the early 1980&#8217;s he traveled extensively<br />
in the then-Soviet Arctic region and across the Canadian North, worked to organize the 1988 Friendship Flight which opened the border between Alaska and Eastern Russia and brought families divided by the Cold War back together. In 1990, he led two expeditions to Wrangel Island in the Russian Arctic, and traveled the Chukotka coastline to pioneer Arctic ecotourism in the Bering Sea region. During his work with the community of Cordova, Alaska during the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, 1989-1990, he was a co-founder of the Alaska-based Prince William Sound Science Center. He later served as Deputy Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and was the state&#8217;s representative to the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, precursor to the eight-nation Arctic Council. In 2001, Treadwell was serving as Managing Director of the Institute of the North at Alaska Pacific University, continuing work with Russia on environmental cooperation, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. From 2006-2010, he was designated chair under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Commission set goals for billions of dollars of funding for field research in the Arctic, advocated for other new science infrastructure worldwide, and helped launch the 2006-2008 International Polar Year. In the private sector, he is a serial entrepreneur. He chaired Immersive Media, the TVX-listed spherical camera company which pioneered StreetView for Google, and chairs the Polar Advisory Board for global satellite network Iridium (NASDAQ:IRDM), used by explorers worldwide. He is chairman of Qilak LNG, a firm working to export LNG by icebreaking tankers through the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Straits, and a member of the board of Alaska cargo airline Ryan Air. He is a Board Member and former President of Pt Capital, an Arctic focused private equity firm, with investment and advisory work in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Finland.

										<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, D.Phil., CBE, is an authority on elephant behaviour and conservation. He attended Gordonstoun School, and later Oxford University where he earned a degree in Zoology and a D.Phil studying the Ecology and Behaviour of the African Elephant. His work in the 1960s paved the way for much of today’s understanding of elephants and current conservation practices. During the 1970s, he investigated the status of elephants throughout Africa and was the first to alert the world to the ivory poaching crisis. He chronicled the diminution of Africa’s elephant population by half between 1979 and 1989 and was instrumental in bringing about the world ivory trade ban. In 1993, Douglas-Hamilton founded Save the Elephants (STE) a charity dedicated specifically to elephants. Since that time Save the Elephants has conducted research on elephants across Africa and has increased public awareness of the many dangers that threaten elephants and the habitats in which they live. Fundamental to his work at STE, Douglas-Hamilton pioneered GPS tracking of elephants in Africa, which has become a standard and widely emulated survey technique; it also guides the deployment of rangers to protect vulnerable and key elephant populations. Douglas-Hamilton and his wife, Oria, have co-authored two award-winning books, Among the Elephants (1975) and Battle for the Elephants (1992), and have made several television films. Dr. Iain Douglas-Hamilton was awarded the 2010 Indianapolis Prize, one of the world&#8217;s leading awards for animal conservation. In 2013 The Elephant Crisis Fund (a joint initiative between Save the Elephants and San Francisco based NGO Wildlife Conservation Network) was established to confront the threat to elephants by supporting the most urgent, important and catalytic projects across the crisis to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and end the demand for ivory. In October 2014 he was presented with the George B Rabb Conservation Medal by the Chicago Zoological Society (CZS) for his authoritative work to benefit African elephants. In 2015 he was awarded the Commander of the British Empire and was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award by San Diego Zoological Society with most recently being awarded the Tanzanian Wildlife Research Institute’s (TAWIRI) Tanzania Wildlife Research Award for his lifelong devotion to elephants. Currently, he is focused on winning hearts and minds to help reduce the demand for ivory, and focus on understanding elephant’s reasons for movements, and their deep history in time.</p>

										<p>Dr. Kenneth Lacovara has unearthed some of the largest dinosaurs ever to walk the earth, including the massive 65-ton <em>Dreadnoughtus</em>, which appeared in the recent film <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>. He is a recipient of The Explorers Club Medal, the club’s highest honor, previously awarded to pioneers such as Sir Edmund Hillary, Jane Goodall, and Neil Armstrong. His TED talk has been viewed by over four million people, and his book, <em>Why Dinosaurs Matter</em>, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, is a winner of the Nautilus Book Prize. Lacovara’s discoveries have landed him three times in Discover magazine’s 100 Top Science Stories of the Year, and he has appeared in 17 television documentaries. Currently, he is researching the extinction of the dinosaurs. He is the founding dean of the School of Earth &amp; Environment at Rowan University, and is executive director of the Edelman Fossil Park &amp; Museum, where he and his team are building a $85M museum designed to connect people to deep time, the contingencies of natural history, and the fragility of our planet.</p>

Taylor is credited with the first functional scientific repair of injured heart with stem cells in 1998. Her group further transformed the field of organ transplantation science in 2008 by developing a unique cell removal (decellularization) method that makes un-transplantable organs into usable scaffold frameworks for building new organs with stem cells. This was so revolutionary it was recognized as one of the “Top 10 Research Advances” by the American Heart Association and Taylor was nominated as one of “100 most influential people in the world” by <em>Time</em> magazine.  Next, she turned to disease prevention and has begun to develop “cellular signatures” of heart disease and aging that appear to differ by sex race and ethnicity.  Dr. Taylor frequently appears as an expert on molecular biology, biobanking, cell therapy, women’s health, cardiac repair and organ transplantation in the public media. Her work has been recognized and featured by 60 Minutes, CNN, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Natonal Geographic, BBC Horizon<strong>, </strong>BBC News Health, ABC, NBC and CBS News, Associated Press, Good Morning America, , the Oprah Winfrey Show, NOVA Science Now, PBS NOVA <em>Transplanting Hope</em>, Discovery Channe<em>l</em>’s<em> Through the Worm Hole with Morgan Freeman</em>, Science Channel’s <em>Stem Cell Universe with Stephen Hawking,</em> NPR’s <em>On Being with Krista Tippet </em>and most other worldwide media outlets. Taylor sits on numerous think tanks and international scientific committees including for the NIH, the FDA, the American Association of Blood Banks, and the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. She serves as a member of the Leadership Advisory Committee for the Alliance for Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) and sat on the international jury for the <em>Institut de France LeFoulon-Delalande Foundation Grand Prix which is awarded annually </em>to individuals making worldwide contributions to cardiovascular medicine. Dr. Taylor earned a B.S. from Mississippi University for Women (MUW) and a Ph.D. from UT Southwestern Medical Center. She is appointed as a Fellow of the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society for Cardiology. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by MUW and the national Distinguished Alumnus Award by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. In 2019 she was elected as a Senior member of the National Academy of Inventors and in 2020, was elected as a fellow to the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering.  Her motto is “Build the Future of Medicine Today.”</p>

										<p>Virginia Riddle Pearson has been working to save elephants from extinction for more than half a century. Her current research focuses on the critical question of why the elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (EEHVs), which have co-evolved with elephants for more than sixty million years, are sometimes lethal in juvenile elephants particularly. She has searched for the origins of this devastating disease in Kenya, Botswana, South Africa, Gabon, Borneo and throughout America  by collecting saliva, blood, and tissues from approximately  two hundred and fifty elephants, including  EEHV-infected skin nodules from living wild elephants exhibiting no clinical signs of disease. By polymerase chair reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing of the DNA from these samples, she has identified elephant herpesviruses, identifying multiple new species and subspecies of EEHVs and elephant gamma herpesviruses (EGHVs,) in almost all the elephants most of which showed no overt disease pathology. Her research shows that the now-known twenty plus EEHVs and EGHVs are endogenous viruses of the three extant species of the Order Proboscidea: <i>Loxodonta</i> <i>africana</i><i>, </i>the African savannah elephant; <i>Loxodonta</i> <i>cyclotis</i>, the African forest elephant; and <i>Elephas maximus</i>, the Asian elephant. The question remains: what causes these endogenous viruses to become pathogenic usually leading quickly to death of the elephant, and can the severe inflammatory response be prevented by vaccines and therapeutics?</p>
<p>She is a Visiting Scientist at Fox Chase Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, and works closely with the Molecular Virology Group at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, to sequence the genomes of the elephant herpesviruses and to replicate the elephant  herpesviruses viruses <i>in vitro </i>for potential vaccine development. She has established numerous primary endothelial and epithelial cell lines  from both African and Asian elephant umbilical cords and amniotic sacs for co-culture of EEHV-positive elephant tissues. Virginia’s recent authored publication describes her creation of a novel recombinant plasmid, encoding viral transforming proteins specific to elephants, that can be used to create immortalized elephant cell lines. She derived this plasmid from an isolate of another elephant virus, African Elephant Polyomavirus (AelPyV-1), that she identified also in a skin nodule biopsy that she had collected from a wild Botswanan elephant  for her EEHVs research.  This plasmid, pAelPyV-1-Tag, has the potential to facilitate durable transformation of primary elephant cells that will be a critical resource for long-study of the elephant-specific herpesviruses in vitro for potential EEHVs vaccine development,  as well as investigation of intrinsic cellular response to DNA damage in elephants that have surprisingly little incidence of cancer as compared to humans,  potentially relevant for the development of effective cancer therapeutics for humans. She was formerly a Guest Researcher in the Department of Molecular Biology at Princeton University, New Jersey, where she began her elephant herpesviruses research in 2006. She is an Honorary Research Associate in Vertebrate Zoology at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the oldest scientific institution of its kind in North America, and an Emeritus Trustee of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, the oldest zoo in America. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Economics at Wellesley College, MA USA.</p>

										<div class="spacer-sm"></div>

										<p>Dr. Ling is a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Virology at Baylor College of Medicine. He spent his graduate and postdoctoral careers investigating human herpesviruses Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). He continued his work on EBV and other animal gammaherpesviruses after moving to Baylor College of Medicine to start his own research program. His lab uses a variety of genetic, biochemical and omics approaches to discover and characterize new intrinsic and innate host responses to infection and to identify viral countermeasures against these responses to understand how these viruses establish long-term chronic infections in their hosts.</p>
<p>In 2010, following the death of 2-year old Mac from elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) at the Houston zoo, a collaboration was established between the zoo and Dr. Lings lab to address the devastating disease caused by this virus, especially in Asian elephant calves. Since that time, his laboratory has leveraged its experience and knowledge of human herpesviruses to combat the threat of EEHV in endangered Asian and African elephants and has emerged as a leading global expert in the field.</p>
<p>Dr. Ling’s lab has an overarching <em>“Bench to Barn”</em> approach to address the EEHV problem. The major activities include generating diagnostics, evaluating treatments, and generating an effective vaccine. His lab is responsible for generating qPCR tests to detect this family of viruses, which are being used world-wide. More recently his lab generated EEHV-specific serology tests, which have provided important insights into factors that may predict vulnerability of elephants for EEHV hemorrhagic disease. Through collaborations with the Baylor College of Medicine Human genome sequencing center, his lab determined the genomic sequences for almost all the EEHV varieties that are known to cause disease in elephants. He has now generated tools for development and evaluation of an EEHV vaccine, which he hopes to implement in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition to his research activities, Dr. Ling previously served as Secretary of the Epstein-Barr virus association and chaired the Microbial Pathogenesis and Cancer study section for the American Cancer Society. He is a member of the EEHV advisory group Steering committee, and is also an Editor for <em>Plos Pathogens</em>. He has trained several students and postdoctoral fellows who are making significant contributions to science in academia and industry.</p>

										<p>Peter Knights is President and Founder of WildAid an international conservation organization based in San Francisco. After graduating from the London School of Economics he worked on wildlife trafficking as an investigator and campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency. This contributed to over 150 airlines stopping the carriage of wild birds and to the Wild Bird Conservation Act, which cut imports of wild birds into the US from 800,000 to 40,000. In 1996, he introduced conservation to the concept of demand reduction, that is now widely accepted as an important tool in solving trafficking problems and received an Associate Laureate of the Rolex Award for Enterprise for this work. In 2000, Peter co-founded WildAid and initiated the Galapagos Forever Program that uses cutting edge technology to police the Galapagos Marine Reserve.</p>
<p>WildAid’s demand reduction program uses sophisticated advertising techniques, donated airtime, and iconic spokespeople with the message “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” More than 100 globally-recognized actors, athletes, musicians and business leaders have appeared in campaigns, including Jackie Chan, Yao Ming, Prince William, David Beckham, Lupita N’yongo and many others. The programs leveraged more than $300 million of donated media space in 2020 and led to 80% reduction in shark fin imports to China and drastic reductions in the price of ivory and rhino horn leading to reductions in poaching.</p>
<p>He is an Emmy-nominated producer and has worked on wildlife in over 40 countries. He has featured at TED and on CNN, BBC, NY Times, Washington Post, Guardian and many other media outlets worldwide. In 2021 received an OBE for his services to conservation.</p>

He is also co-Founder and global director at Biotia, co-Founder and scientific director at Onegevity, Director of Genomics at Tempus Labs, and recently published The Next 500 Years: Engineering Life to Reach New Worlds.</p>
<p>Dr. Mason develops and deploys computational and experimental methodologies to identify the functional genetic elements of the human genome and metagenome. To do this, we perform research in three principal areas: (1) molecular profiling in patients with extreme phenotypes, including brain malformations, aggressive cancers, and astronauts, (2) creating new biochemical and computational techniques in DNA/RNA sequencing and DNA/RNA base modifications, and (3) the development of new cell and genome modifications. In the very long term, we believe these systems-based methods will enable an understanding of the functional elements of the human genome and embedded metagenome, such that we can begin to repair or re-engineer these genetic networks for ameliorating disease and lay the foundation to enable long-term human spaceflight.</p>
<p>Dr. Mason has won the NIH’s Transformative R01 Award, the NASA Group Achievement Award, the Pershing Square Sohn Cancer Research Alliance Young Investigator award, the Hirschl-Weill-Caulier Career Scientist Award, the Vallee Scholar Award, the International Space Station (ISS) Research and Development Award, the CDC Honor Award for Standardization of Clinical Testing, and the WorldQuant Foundation Scholar Award.  He was named as one of the “Brilliant Ten” Scientists by Popular Science, featured as a TEDMED speaker, and called “The Genius of Genetics” by 92Y. He has written 2 books and &gt;300 peer-reviewed papers, featured on the covers of <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>Cell,</em> <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>, <em>Nature Microbiology</em>, and <em>Neuron</em>, as well as legal briefs cited by the U.S. District Court and U.S. Supreme Court.  Coverage of his work has also appeared on the covers of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>New York Times</em>, TIME, <em>The LA Times</em>, and across many media (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, PBS, NASA, NatGeo). He is an inventor on four patents, co-creator of five FDA-authorized diagnostic tests, founded five biotechnology companies, and he serves as an advisor to 21 others, as well as 3 non-profits. He lives with his daughter and wife in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hobbs is a physician-scientist and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in Dallas, Texas. She is a graduate of Stanford University and Case Western Reserve Medical School (Cleveland OH). Afterwards she trained in internal medicine and endocrinology at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital (NYC) and UTSW and then joined the UTSW faculty in 1987. Together with Jonathan C. Cohen, she spearheaded establishment of the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a multiethnic, population-based study of heart and metabolic diseases. In that population, she tested the hypothesis that DNA sequence variations with major phenotypic effects contribute to complex disorders. This approach unveiled a powerful strategy to dissect disease pathogenesis that was initially used to identify genetic differences that confer protection from atherosclerotic heart disease. She identified new sequence variations/genes contributing to differences in plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride (TG). These studies revealed new targets that led to the development of FDA-approved therapeutic antibodies (anti-PCSK9 and -ANGPTL3). She identified the first and most important genetic difference contributing to fatty liver disease. Gene identification is just the starting point of her studies. Ongoing functional analyses have elucidated the pathways and processes that are altered by the defective genes identified in the genetic studies. Her work has been recognized by several national and international organizations.  She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among the prizes she has received are the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Grand Prix Award from the Institute of France, and the Harrington Prize for Innovation and Medicine.  She has been on the Board of Pfizer, Inc. since 2011 and has consulted for the Column Group since 2019.</span></p>

<p>David Haussler develops statistical, algorithmic and experimental methods to explore molecular function and evolution in the human genome, integrating comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation. He develops and shares infrastructure to support both basic research and medicine. In the 1990s, he pioneered the use in genomics of hidden Markov models, stochastic context-free grammars, neural networks and discriminative kernel methods, building some of the most successful computational methods to find genes in genome sequences and align them to detect evolutionary changes. As collaborators on the international Human Genome Project, his team created the first publicly available computational assembly of the human genome sequence and posted it on the Internet on July 7, 2000. They subsequently developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool that has more than 10,000 users on average per day generating more than 1 million page requests.</p>
<p>His experimental research focuses on the molecular evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences with a special emphasis on neurodevelopment and immunology. His lab uses CRISPR, cortical organoid, single cell RNA-seq and other technologies to functionally characterize neurodevelopmental genes that were specifically altered in human evolution. His team develops and shares infrastructure to support both research in and the clinical application of precision medicine.</p>
<p>Haussler received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. He has won a number of awards, including the 2015 Dan David Prize in the future category, 2011 Weldon Memorial prize for application of mathematics and statistics to biology, 2009 ASHG Curt Stern Award in Human Genetics, the 2008 Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award from the International Society for Computational Biology, the 2006 Dickson Prize for Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

The McGrew laboratory studies a kind of animal stem cell, the germ cell, which produces the sperm and eggs of birds. His research group developed a serum free culture medium to grow chicken germ cells indefinitely in vitro and developed a genetically sterile surrogate host chicken that carry the germ cells from any breed of chicken and produce healthy offspring. They use these systems to investigate the genes involved in sexual determination and gametogenesis, develop genome editing technologies and for ‘biobanking’ of bird reproductive cells.</p>

										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prof. Fritz Vollrath studied Biology in Göttingen and Freiburg, Germany, and held professorial positions in Basel CH, Aarhus DK and Oxford GB.  Fritz’s academic research embraces two rather distinct areas of Zoology: spider webs &amp; silks and elephant behavior, ecology &amp; evolution. His silk interests range from fundamental research into the mechanical and molecular properties of this important natural material to the fabrication and commercialization of silk-based high-tech products.  Fritz’s elephant research combines fieldwork on their behavioural ecology with applications to their conservation as well as more speculative research into the molecular basis of the elephant’s anti-cancer defences.</span></p>

										<p>Victor L. Vescovo is a private investor with over thirty years of experience in a variety of complex business situations. He co-founded private equity firm Insight Equity in 2002 with his business partner, Ted Beneski, and raised over $1.5 billion in equity capital across four funds investing primarily in industrial, asset-intensive industries. Victor’s primary investment focus while at the firm were in the defense, aerospace, and electronics industries with a specific emphasis on executing operational improvements at the investments as Insight’s Chief Operating Officer. In 2023, he departed Insight in order to focus on his own investments with new capabilities to support industrial startups, life sciences, and other areas of venture capital and special situations.</p>
<p>Victor received his bachelor’s degree from Stanford University, a Master’s Degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and received an MBA from Harvard Business School where he graduated as a Baker Scholar. Additionally, Victor served 20 years in the U.S. Navy Reserve as an intelligence and targeting officer, retiring in 2013 as a Commander.</p>
<p>In 2017, Victor completed the “Explorer’s Grand Slam” which requires climbing the highest peak on all seven of the world’s continents including Mt. Everest and skiing at least 100 kilometers to the North and South Poles. He piloted the first repeated dives to the ocean’s deepest point, Challenger Deep, in the Pacific’s Mariana Trench &#8212; now fifteen times, and in August 2019 became the first person to visit “The Five Deeps,” the deepest point in all five of the world’s oceans. Victor has now personally explored the bottom of seventeen deep ocean trenches and has made three dives to the Titanic including the only solo dive ever made there. He and his team also discovered and surveyed the two deepest shipwrecks in the world: the USS Johnston in 2021 and the deepest, the USS Samuel B. Roberts at 22,600 feet, in 2022. In 2025, the US Navy announced that T-AGOS 26, a new ocean surveillance vessel of the Explorer class, would be named after him.</p>
<p>He is also a commercially rated, multi-engine jet, seaplane, and helicopter pilot, a certified submersible test pilot, and recently flew into space on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, becoming the first person in history to climb Mount Everest, dive to the bottom of the ocean, and visit space.</p>

He is a Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where he has directed the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility for about 20 years. Primarily focusing on the Arctic, Mat has used cutting edge isotopic techniques to reconstruct past climates, ecosystems and the diets of some of the earliest people in Alaska. His lab’s isotopic analyses of a mammoth tusk were used to provide an unprecedent and detailed perspective on the movement ecology of a male, adult mammoth that was alive in Alaska at the height of the last ice age. Mat is the founder and lead of the “Adopt a Mammoth” project that is coupling crowd-sourcing, radiocarbon dating and ancient DNA techniques to study the University of Alaska Museum of the North’s large collection of mammoth fossils in a hunt for the most recent mammoth that existed in mainland Alaska. As an open and collaborative paleo-ecological researcher, Mat integrates isotope techniques amongst a wide range of other approaches for studying the past, including analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils, insect remains and his newly found interest in paleo-proteomics.</p>

										<p class="">Shane C. Campbell-Staton is an American evolutionary biologist. Since July 2021, he has been an assistant professor in the ecology and evolutionary biology department at Princeton, where he leads a research group. His work is on how phenotypes respond to human activity that affects the environment. He also hosts the podcast &#8216;Biology of Superheroes&#8217; together with Arien Darby. Shane is interested in how human history, culture, technology and politics influence life, biological stress and evolution of species around the world. He uses physiology, gene expression, genomics and experimentation to identify genes and traits that allow animals to rapidly adapt to new environmental pressures faced in a human-dominated world. Shane also has a deep passion for sharing science with the public. His own passion for science was kindled through television as a child. Growing up in a small town in South Carolina, he was not exposed to much nature or the outdoors. But watching nature documentaries and TV shows featuring passionate presenters, like Steve Irwin and Jeff Corwin, he developed a love for the natural world. Now Shane is sharing his own passions and the wonders of science with a diverse audience through his research as well as visual and audio media.</p>

										<div class="spacer-sm"></div>

										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Hofreiter is scientific advisor for Colossal Bioscience. He is Professor for Evolutionary Adaptive Genomics at the University of Potsdam, Germany. His research focuses on paleogenomics of extinct species such as mammoth, dwarf elephants, cave bears and other Pleistocene megafauna. Michael studied biology in Munich where he met the father of ancient DNA analyses, Svante Pääbo, who was a professor at the Ludwig Maximilians University at this time. Michael followed Svante to the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig as a PhD student and received his PhD from the University of Leipzig in 2002. He continued working at the MPI EVA, first as a postdoc and, from 2005-2009, as a research group leader. In 2009, he was appointed as Professor for Evolutionary Biology and Ecology at the University of York. In 2013, he was offered his current professorship in Potsdam, where he has worked since then.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael has published on ancient DNA since 1998. While his interest is mainly in deciphering the evolutionary history of &#8211; mostly mammalian &#8211; species, he has also published a large number of technical studies and was among the first to apply next generation sequencing to ancient DNA. His research started on short segments of ancient DNA pieced together via PCR, but since the introduction of next generation sequencing in 2005, it has shifted more and more towards deciphering complete genomes, which allow tremendous insights into the evolution and past life of extinct creatures. Michael has worked on numerous species, but he has a special interest in cave bears and extinct elephant species (including the mammoth). Among his publications are a number of papers that resolved the phylogenetic relationship of the mammoth to the living elephants, a genomic analysis that showed that the extinct straight tusked elephant was a hybrid species, the first mitochondrial genome of an extinct dwarf elephant and the oldest genome from outside the permafrost, obtained from a 360,000 year old cave bear bone.</span></p>

										<p>Erez Lieberman Aiden received his PhD from Harvard and MIT in 2010. After several years at Harvard&#8217;s Society of Fellows and at Google as Visiting Faculty, he moved to the Baylor College of Medicine, where he is now an Associate Professor, with additional appointments at Rice University and ShanghaiTech.</p>
<p>Dr. Aiden&#8217;s inventions include the Hi-C method for three-dimensional DNA sequencing, which enables scientists to examine how the two-meter long human genome folds up inside the tiny space of the cell nucleus (Lieberman-Aiden &amp; Van Berkum et al., <em>Science</em>, 2009). In 2014, his laboratory reported the first comprehensive map of loops across the human genome, mapping their anchors with single-base-pair resolution (Rao &amp; Huntley et al., <em>Cell</em>, 2014). In 2015, his lab showed that these loops form by extrusion, and that it is possible to add and remove loops and domains in a predictable fashion using targeted mutations as short as a single base pair (Sanborn &amp; Rao et al., <em>PNAS</em>, 2014). In 2017, Dr. Aiden and Olga Dudchenko showed that it is possible to use 3D maps, generated using Hi-C, to reliably and inexpensively assemble whole chromosomes (Dudchenko et al., <em>Science</em>, 2017). Today, Hi-C is a key component of most contemporary genome projects.</p>
<p>Together with Jean-Baptiste Michel, Dr. Aiden also developed the Google Ngram Viewer, a tool for probing cultural change by exploring the frequency of words and phrases in books over the centuries. This tool is used by billions of people as a part of Google Search.</p>
<p>Dr. Aiden&#8217;s research has won numerous awards, including recognition for one of the top 20 &#8220;Biotech Breakthroughs that will Change Medicine&#8221;, by Popular Mechanics, membership in Technology Review&#8217;s 2009 TR35, recognizing the top 35 innovators under 35; and in Cell&#8217;s 2014 40 Under 40. His work has been featured on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Boston Globe</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>. One of his talks has been viewed millions of times at <em>TED.com</em>; four of his research papers have appeared on the cover of <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em> and <em>Cell</em>. In 2012, he received the President&#8217;s Early Career Award in Science and Engineering, the highest government honor for young scientists, from Barack Obama. In 2014, <em>Fast Company</em> called him &#8220;America&#8217;s brightest young academic.&#8221; In 2015, his laboratory was recognized on the floor of the US House of Representatives for its discoveries about the structure of DNA.</p>
