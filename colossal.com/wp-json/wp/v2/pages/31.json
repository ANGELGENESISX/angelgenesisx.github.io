It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.<\/i> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution<\/i>. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (<b>\u201cNotice\u201d<\/b>) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company must be sent to the Company\u2019s mailing address at the bottom of these Terms. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the dispute within thirty days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Arbitration Rules<\/b>. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>AAA<\/b>\u201d), or a similar arbitration association (\u201c<b>ADR Provider<\/b>\u201d) and shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201c<b>Arbitration Rules<\/b>\u201d). The arbitration shall be conducted in English by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney\u2019s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Time Limits.<\/i> If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and\/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Authority of Arbitrator<\/i>. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Waiver of Jury Trial.<\/i> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions<\/i>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Confidentiality<\/i>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Emergency Equitable Relief<\/i>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. <\/i>Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Courts.<\/i> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Travis County, Texas, for such purpose<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>EXPORT.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

We may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us, or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website or within the Services. Continued use of our Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>GENERAL TERMS.<\/b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be a waiver of such provision. The word \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cincluding without limitation\u201d. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision may be modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
